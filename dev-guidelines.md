# Development guidelines

- Every folder should have index file
- Every component should start with capital letter
- Index file will only be used for imports and exports
- Always import/export in alphabetical order
- Destructure in alphabetical order
- Global imports should always be in top
- Separate local imports from the global imports
- Utils - does not depend on context
- Never use magical number. Use constants for that.
- Constants should always be capitalized
- Use enum to group the constants
